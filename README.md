# Link Conversion Discord Bot 

A Discord bot that enhances your social media sharing experience by converting various social media links to their enhanced versions for better embeds in Discord. Originally designed for Twitter and Instagram, this bot now extends its functionality to convert any links, providing better embeds than the default ones. No commands are neededâ€”simply add the bot to your server and start sharing. The bot will delete your original message and repost it using webhooks to mimic your display name and avatar, ensuring a seamless integration into your Discord conversations. Commands are available for further customization of its behaviour.
